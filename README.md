## Manual setup

step by step how to create and the code explanations

1. First of all this is the python main logic code

```py
import requests
import json
import sys

# Replace with your actual API key
API_KEY = "AIzaSyCfc0ej_s8AKNiIFccX0P0Vk_gjvcsxPak"

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    user_input = sys.argv[1]
else:
    print("No input text provided.")
    exit()

# Define the URL of the API endpoint
url = f"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta2/models/text-bison-001:generateText?key={API_KEY}"

# Prepare the data to be sent
data = {
    "prompt": {
        "text": user_input
    }
}

# Set headers with content type as JSON
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Send POST request with headers and data
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Check for successful response
if response.status_code == 200:
    try:
        response_data = response.json()
        # Fetch the generated content
        generated_text = response_data.get('candidates', [{}])[0].get('output', 'No output found.')

        # Check if the response contains a numerical result
        if generated_text.strip().isdigit():
            print("Genie: Iâ€™m sorry, I only answer bash specific questions.")
        else:
            # Print the response
            print(f"Genie: {generated_text.strip()}")
    except (KeyError, IndexError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        print(f"Error parsing response: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

<br/>

The logic behind keeping genie only in the topic of bash commands is by passing a pre prompt that engineers the output for a specific case

```py
text="Help with any question I ask about Linux bash commands only in very summarized answer with a short example usage and don't add any markdown styling make sure all the output you give is pair text. other wise if my question is off topic please only answer politely by refusing to answer this question. So my questions is : "+" ".join(sys.argv[1:])
```
<br /><br /><br />
2. Now about how to convert the normal python code into a ready to install application for any Debian based Linux disruptions
by copying the above code don't forget to set your own API key [in this step](#get-your-own-api-key)
and set it in a file named `genie.py`
get the path of the file
```bash
pwd ./genie.py
```
copy the output and add `/genie.py` at the end of it
```bash
pwd genie

/home/<usrName>
```
thus the path is : 
`/home/<usrName>/genie.py`
copy it and keep it for the next step.

do the following 
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

this will open a file for you in which go to `last line` in the file and add the following : 
```bash
alias genie='python3 /home/<usrName>/genie.py'
```

Now you are behind one step from the glow!
update the new settings for the system to read by doing : 
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
<br />
